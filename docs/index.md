<!-- ###### Welcome to the BEHOMO project! -->


It is generally assumed that the universe is statistically homogeneous on very large scales, larger than 100 Mpc, roughly 300 millions light-years. Consequently, cosmologists often adopt a homogeneous and isotropic metric for the universe, the FLRW metric, on top of which perturbations are added. These perturbations come from inflation and generate, via gravity, the cosmic web of voids, walls, filaments and clusters that we see in the large-scale structure of the universe.

This standard paradigm is consistent to a good degree by observations. However, it is very difficult to study the universe without making strong assumptions and large-scale homogeneity and isotropy could be violated to some degree.
Indeed, several anomalous signals in cosmological observables have been emerging, possibly challenging the foundations of the standard model of cosmology.

The BEHOMO project studies, via the methods of numerical cosmology, the evolution of the large-scale structure on an inhomogeneous background.
The basic idea is to introduce non-standard large-scale perturbations on top of the FLRW metric, and understand how cosmological structures evolve and how the corresponding observables are modified in an inhomogeneous universe.
This will allow us to constrain, with present and future data, deviations from large-scale homogeneity and isotropy and place the standard model of cosmology on more solid grounds.
