###### Welcome to the BEHOMO project!  


It is generally assumed that the universe is statistically homogeneous on very large scales, larger than 100 Mpc, roughly 300 millions light-years. Consequently, cosmologists often adopt a homogeneous and isotropic metric for the universe, on top of which perturbations are added. These perturbations are the cosmic web of voids, walls, filaments and clusters that we see in the large-scale structure that was mapped via gaalxy catalogs.




Cosmological observables are often analyzed withing the framework 

I am a cosmologist,  [rep](https://github.com/valerio-marra/BEHOMO-project).
