### BEHOMO suite of LLTB simulations

<div style="text-align: justify">
The data products consist of the 11 even-numbered snapshots listed in the table below, for each of the 68 simulations that have been performed, together with halo catalogs and lens planes relative to all the snapshots, for a total of approximately 180 TB of data. Data can be obtained upon request.
<br/><br/>
This is the first set of simulations of the Î›LTB model ever produced. These Newtonian N-body simulations can perfectly reproduce the general relativistic evolution even for deep Hubble-sized inhomogeneities. For more informations, see <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.xxxx">Marra etal 2203.xxxx</a>.
