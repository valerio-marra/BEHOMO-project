During my research activity I developed several codes. The main ones are

* [**hi_class**](http://www.hiclass-code.net/): an implementation of the Horndeski class of models in the modern Einstein-Boltzmann solver [Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System](http://www.class-code.net/) (CLASS). Widely used in the community to test Dark Energy and Modified Gravity theories. Written and maintained with [M. Zumalac√°rregui](http://miguelzuma.github.io/), [I. Sawicki](https://www.ceico.cz/team/researchers/ignacy-sawicki), [P.G. Ferreira](http://www.pedroferreira.co.uk/), [J. Lesgourgues](https://lesgourg.github.io/)
* [**xSVT**](https://github.com/emiliobellini/xSVT): developed mainly during my Ph.D. but constantly used and maintained this tool allows to easily compute linear and non-linear perturbation theory on cosmological backgrounds. It is built on top of [xAct](http://www.xact.es/), a free [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) package for tensor algebra.

You can also check out my GitHub page to see what other codes I have

An incomplete and random list of my favourite software is
* [CLASS](http://www.class-code.net/): Einstein-Boltzmann solver to compute cosmological observables
* [Montepython](https://github.com/brinckmann/montepython_public): Monte Carlo code for Cosmological Parameter extraction
* [xAct](http://www.xact.es/): tensor computer algebra in the Wolfram Language
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/): notebooks that contain live code. I use it every day!
* [Atom](https://atom.io/): modern code editor
* [LyX](https://www.lyx.org/): WYSIWYM latex editor. Fantastic also for analytic calculations
* [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/): notebooks for technical computing in Wolfram language
